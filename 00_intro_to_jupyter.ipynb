    "Jupyter notebooks have two main types of cells: **Markdown** and **Code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Markdown** cells allow you to use symbols that are then rendered into nicely formatted text, tables, images, etc. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) was created in 2004 as a plain text languge for generating formatted text that was itself readable in plain text. It is now widely used across many platforms. While there is a base standard, implementations can differ in some details. The official [Jupyter Notebook markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) documentation provides a good overview. You will mostly not need to create markdown for the *Practicum AI* courses, but it will be used to provide the explanatory information for you as you run the code.\n",

    "   * While a cell is running, the square brackets will have an asterisk ([\\*]). Some cells, especially model training cells, can take some time to run. While one cell is running, all other cells will be blocked from running. In a notebook, only one cell can run at a time.\n",
